          <b><i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i></b> is the fifth studio
          album by the American rapper Kanye West. It was released by Def Jam
          Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records on November 22, 2010. Retreating to
          a self-imposed exile in Hawaii after a period of controversy in 2009,
          following his interruption of Taylor Swift at the MTV Video Music
          Awards, West recorded the album at Honolulu's Avex Recording Studio in
          a communal environment involving numerous musicians. Additional
          recording sessions took place at Glenwood Place Studios in Burbank,
          California, along with the New York City studios Electric Lady and
          Platinum Sound.
          <br />
          <br />
          <i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i> was mainly produced by West,
          alongside a variety of high-profile producers such as Mike Dean, No
          I.D., Jeff Bhasker, RZA, Bink, and DJ Frank E. Critics noted the
          music's maximalist aesthetic and opulent production style that
          utilizes various elements from his previous work, including soul, pop,
          baroque, electro, and symphonic sounds, as well as progressive rock
          influences. The album's lyrics explore themes such as West's celebrity
          status, consumer culture, self-aggrandizement, and the idealism of the
          American Dream. Guest vocalists include Nicki Minaj, Rihanna, Jay-Z,
          Pusha T, Rick Ross, Kid Cudi, John Legend, Bon Iver, and Elton John.

          <br />
          Alongside several free songs released through West's weekly GOOD
          Fridays series, he supported My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy with
          four US Billboard Hot 100 top-40 singles, "Power", "Runaway",
          "Monster", and "All of the Lights". West also released an accompanying
          musical short film, Runaway (2010). The album was an immediate and
          widespread critical success, and reviewers lauded the maximalist
          approach. It was listed as the best album of 2010 in many
          publications' year-end lists.
          <i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i> was awarded Best Rap Album at
          the 54th Annual Grammy Awards and CD of the Year at the 2011 BET Hip
          Hop Awards.
          <br />
          <br />
          <i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i> debuted at number one on the
          US Billboard 200 and the Canadian Albums Chart, while reaching the top
          10 in six other countries. The album eventually achieved a triple
          platinum certification in the United States from the Recording
          Industry Association of America, alongside sales certifications in a
          few other territories. It was ranked in lists as the best album of the
          2010s and among the greatest of all time by several publications,
          including Pitchfork and Rolling Stone.
