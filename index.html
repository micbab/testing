      <b><i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i></b> is the fifth studio album
      by the American rapper Kanye West. It was released by Def Jam Recordings
      and Roc-A-Fella Records on November 22, 2010. Retreating to a self-imposed
      exile in Hawaii after a period of controversy in 2009, following his
      interruption of Taylor Swift at the MTV Video Music Awards, West recorded
      the album at Honolulu's Avex Recording Studio in a communal environment
      involving numerous musicians. Additional recording sessions took place at
      Glenwood Place Studios in Burbank, California, along with the New York
      City studios Electric Lady and Platinum Sound.
